# Lesson 01 – Course Introduction (Summary)

This lesson provides an overview of the **Operating Systems and Networking Essentials** module and explains the course structure, tools, and learning approach.

## 🔹 Course Scope
The module covers nine core areas:
1. **Operating Systems** — architecture, features, memory management, processes  
2. **Windows** — file system, user vs. kernel mode, PowerShell scripting  
3. **Linux** — kernel, permissions, user management, Bash scripting  
4. **Computer Networks** — network types, topologies, NICs, components  
5. **TCP/IP** — network model, DNS, ports, Wireshark basics  
6. **ICMP & Related Protocols** — ARP, addressing, subnetting, basic cryptography  
7. **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** — CAs, certificates, digital signatures  
8. **WLAN Security** — wireless vulnerabilities, segmentation, AAA  
9. **Course Components** — interactive labs, assisted practice, lesson-end projects

## 🔹 Why OS Knowledge Matters for Cybersecurity
- The OS manages memory, files, processes, and access controls.  
- Windows and Linux each provide distinct security controls and tools (e.g., Group Policy, SELinux, iptables, PowerShell).  
- OS knowledge helps with system hardening, detection, scripting, and incident response.

## 🔹 Why Networking Matters for Cybersecurity
- Networks are the backbone of device communication and data transfer.  
- Key threats include DoS, Man-in-the-Middle, malware, and unauthorized access.  
- Core defensive tools: Firewalls, VPNs, IDS/IPS, SIEM, EDR.

## 🔹 Course Components & Deliverables
- **Interactive labs** for hands-on practice  
- **Lesson-end projects** to apply concepts  
- **Assisted exercises** and guided scenarios

## 🔹 Emerging Trends Highlighted
- Zero Trust architectures and segmentation  
- Enhanced OS-level isolation and sandboxing  
- Improved EDR and AI-based threat detection  
- Security considerations for IoT and 5G networks
